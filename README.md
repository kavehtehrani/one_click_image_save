# One-Click Image Saver

No more right-clicking and saving images manually.

A simple extension to save images with one click only. The default shortcut is "CTRL + ALT + LEFT CLICK" to save the image. This is customizable in the
extension settings.

No ads, no tracking, no behind-the-scene snooping. Open source and free to use! Comments welcome.
